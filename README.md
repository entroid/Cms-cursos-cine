# 🚀 Getting started with Strapi

Strapi comes with a full featured [Command Line Interface](https://docs.strapi.io/dev-docs/cli) (CLI) which lets you scaffold and manage your project in seconds.

## ⚡ Prerequisites

Before running the Strapi server, you need to start the PostgreSQL database using Docker.

### 1. Start Docker Desktop

Make sure Docker Desktop is running on your machine. You can start it from the Windows Start menu.

### 2. Start PostgreSQL Database

```powershell
# Start the PostgreSQL container
docker-compose up -d
```

This will start the `cine_strapi_db` container in the background.

### 3. Verify Database is Running

```powershell
# Check if the database container is running
docker ps
```

You should see a container named `cine_strapi_db` with status "Up".

### 4. Stop the Database (when needed)

```powershell
# Stop the PostgreSQL container
docker-compose down
```

> **Note**: The database data is persisted in a Docker volume (`cine_strapi_data`), so stopping the container won't delete your data.
